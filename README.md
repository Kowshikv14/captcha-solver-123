# Captcha Solver Web App This is a simple, single-file responsive web application designed to help with manual captcha solving or as a base for integrating automated solutions. It allows users to load captcha images either from a predefined local sample or from an external URL, and then input their perceived solution for checking (for the sample image) or submission (for external images). ## Features *   **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly user interface. *   **Load Captcha Images:**     *   Loads `sample.png` by default if no URL parameter is provided.     *   Supports loading captcha images via a URL query parameter (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`).     *   Allows manual input of an image URL to dynamically load a captcha. *   **Solution Input:** Provides an input field for users to type in the captcha text. *   **Basic Solution Check:** For the `sample.png` image (which displays "ADCR3"), the app provides immediate feedback on whether the entered solution is correct. For external URLs, it acknowledges the submission as a placeholder for a real server-side check. ## How to Use 1.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.** 2.  **Loading Captchas:**     *   **Default:** The `sample.png` captcha will be displayed.     *   **Via URL Parameter:** Append `?url=https://your-image-url.com/captcha.png` to the `index.html` URL in your browser's address bar and press Enter.     *   **Manual Input:** Type an image URL into the "Image URL" field and click "Load Captcha". 3.  **Enter Solution:** Type the text you see in the captcha image into the "Your Solution" field. 4.  **Submit:** Click the "Submit Solution" button to check your answer (for `sample.png`) or submit it (for other images). ## Technologies Used *   **HTML5:** Structure of the web page. *   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design. *   **JavaScript:** For dynamic content loading and client-side logic. ## Project Structure *   `index.html`: The main single-file web application. *   `README.md`: This file, providing project overview and instructions. *   `LICENSE`: The MIT License text. *   `sample.png`: The default captcha image. ## Disclaimer This application provides a client-side interface for solving captchas. The "solver" aspect for `sample.png` is a hardcoded check against a known value. For external captcha images, it merely provides an input and submission mechanism, as real captcha solving (OCR, complex image processing, etc.) typically requires server-side capabilities.
